# Functions

This page briefly describes the functions exported by the package.

The function names in this module are in lowercase letters and sometimes underscores are used for longer function names.
Most functions require keyword arguments, i.e. `bodyparts(collection = collection_name)` will work but `bodyparts(collection_name)` will not.
